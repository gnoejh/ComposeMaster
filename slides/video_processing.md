## 1. Comparison of Video and Camera Components in Android

This section compares the core components used for video playback and camera preview in Android, highlighting their roles as "player," "viewer," and "effect" components.

| **Category**         | **Video (ExoPlayer)**                                        | **Camera (CameraX)**                                                 | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Player**           | `ExoPlayer`                                                  | `ProcessCameraProvider`                                              | Manages the data source and its lifecycle. The video player loads and decodes media, while the camera provider manages camera hardware and binds use cases.     |
| **Role**             | - Loads and decodes video/audio streams.<br>- Manages playback (play, pause, seek).<br>- Handles buffering. | - Manages the camera device.<br>- Binds use cases to the camera.<br>- Handles lifecycle events.<br>- Provides the camera feed. | The player controls data access and preparation, and the camera provider ensures proper management of the live camera feed.                                          |
| **Data Source**      | Video/Audio files (local or network)                         | Camera device                                                        | The origin of the data used for display.                                                                                                                          |
| **Viewer**           | `AndroidView` (typically wrapping a `PlayerView`)            | `PreviewView`                                                        | UI components that display the media. They provide the surfaces where video frames or live camera feeds are rendered.                                               |
| **Effect**           | `GlEffect`                                                   | `GlEffect`                                                           | Allows real-time processing or effects to be applied to the media (e.g., filters, overlays, distortions).                                                            |
| **Data Flow**        | `ExoPlayer` â†’ (Optional `GlEffect`) â†’ `AndroidView`            | `ProcessCameraProvider` â†’ `Preview` â†’ (Optional `GlEffect`) â†’ `PreviewView` | Describes the sequence from the data source through optional effects to the final display.                                                                          |
| **Thread Management**| ExoPlayer manages threads internally for decoding and rendering. | CameraX uses an ExecutorService for camera processing.               | Both components internally handle thread management to ensure smooth operation.                                                                                   |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Managed by the `LifecycleOwner`                        | Managed by the `LifecycleOwner`                                      | Binding the components to the lifecycle ensures proper resource allocation and cleanup.                                                                            |
| **Control**          | Functions like play, pause, stop, and seek are provided.       | Functions to open, close, and bind the camera to a lifecycle are provided. | These control methods allow developers to manage the media or camera feed effectively.                                                                              |

### Key Takeaways

- **Player/Engine:** Both `ExoPlayer` and `ProcessCameraProvider` serve as the "brains" of their respective systems.
- **Viewer:** `AndroidView` (for video) and `PreviewView` (for camera) are the screens where the data is rendered.
- **Data Source:**
    - `ExoPlayer`: Handles media files (video, audio).
    - `ProcessCameraProvider`: Interfaces directly with the camera hardware.
- **Effects:** `GlEffect` can be applied to enhance the visual experience.
- **Data Flow:** The typical pipeline is: **Player** â†’ (Optional **Effect**) â†’ **Viewer**.
- **Lifecycle & Thread Management:** Both systems integrate with the `LifecycleOwner` and manage background threads for smooth processing.

## 2. Video Processing with ExoPlayer

ExoPlayer is a robust media player for handling video playback within Jetpack Compose.

### 2.1 Video Playback Implementation

```kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current
val player = remember {
    ExoPlayer.Builder(context).build().apply {
        setMediaItem(MediaItem.fromUri(videoUri))
        prepare()
        playWhenReady = true
    }
}

AndroidView(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    factory = { PlayerView(it).apply { this.player = player } }
)
```

### 2.2 Video Effects Implementation

Apply video effects (e.g., grayscale) using:

```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
    player.setVideoEffects(listOfNotNull(RgbFilter.createGrayscaleFilter()))
}
```

## 3. Camera Processing with CameraX

CameraX simplifies integration and manipulation of live camera feeds.

### 3.1 Camera Preview Implementation

Set up a `PreviewView` and bind it with a camera preview use case:

```kotlin
val previewView = remember {
    PreviewView(context).apply {
        implementationMode = PreviewView.ImplementationMode.COMPATIBLE
    }
}
```

Bind the preview:

```kotlin
val preview = androidx.camera.core.Preview.Builder().build().also {
    it.setSurfaceProvider(previewView.surfaceProvider)
}
```

### 3.2 Camera Effects Implementation

Apply various effects to the camera feed:

| **Effect Name**         | **Implementation Method**                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| No Effect               | Default CameraX Preview                  |
| Inverted                | `shaderInverted()`                       |
| Grayscale LUT           | `shaderCustom()`                         |
| Edge Detection          | `CustomEdgeDetectionShader()`            |
| Sepia Filter            | `CustomSepiaToneShader()`                |
| Background Blur         | `CustomBackgroundBlur()`                 |
| Night Mode              | `CustomLowLightEnhancement()`            |
| HDR Enhancement         | `CustomHDREffect()`                      |

## 4. Summary

This guide demonstrates how to integrate **ExoPlayer for video playback** and **CameraX for live camera feeds** in Jetpack Compose. It covers how to apply various **video and camera effects** using methods like `GlEffect`, OpenGL shaders, and custom drawing techniques with `Canvas`. By leveraging Jetpack Compose's integration with these technologies, developers can create rich multimedia applications with advanced video processing capabilities.
